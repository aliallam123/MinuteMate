Project Aims (15%)

The aim of this project is to design and evaluate an AI-powered meeting assistant, MinuteMate, that automates the recording, transcription, and summarisation of business meetings. The goal is to address the challenges of manual note-taking by creating a scalable, reliable, and user-friendly solution that enhances productivity in professional service environments.

The project will pursue the following five aims:
To evaluate the technical feasibility of combining voice-to-text transcription and large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate, real-time meeting summaries.


To assess the usability and user experience requirements for integrating an AI assistant into professional workflows, particularly for client-facing roles.


To investigate the productivity benefits, such as reducing administrative workload, improving knowledge capture, and streamlining post-meeting actions.


To explore scalability, data privacy, and reliability challenges associated with deploying such an AI solution within a professional organisation.


To benchmark existing tools (e.g. Microsoft Copilot, Otter.ai) and identify differentiators that would position MinuteMate as a viable commercial alternative.
