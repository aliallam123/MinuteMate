The paper titled "Online Meeting Summariser and Report Generation Using GenAI" by Sanika Ingle et al. (2025) presents a thorough examination of leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the summarisation and generation of reports from online meeting transcripts. The paper is highly relevant to the MinuteMate project, as it directly aligns with the project's core objective of creating an AI agent capable of accurately transcribing and summarising meetings, improving workplace productivity and efficiency.

Critically, the paper demonstrates substantial quality in both its theoretical foundations and its exploration of practical methodologies. The authors effectively review a wide array of approaches, including deep learning techniques, hierarchical neural network models, and multimodal integration. One of the paper's standout features is its deep exploration of context-aware summarisation, considering factors such as sentiment analysis, voice modulation, and face recognition. These additional dimensions indicate a sophisticated understanding of the complexities involved in accurate summarisation, aligning closely with the MinuteMate project's aims of producing nuanced and contextually accurate meeting minutes.

Methodologically, the paper engages robustly with current technologies, detailing specific architectures such as hierarchical adaptive segmental networks and dependency graph fusion, which significantly improve the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated summaries. Moreover, it thoroughly addresses existing challenges, notably linguistic ambiguities, privacy concerns, and multimodal data stream integration. The inclusion of detailed Rouge score analyses of different methodologies enriches the paper's empirical basis, providing clear benchmarks that could inform MinuteMate’s developmental approach.

One limitation observed is the absence of direct experimental or empirical validation conducted by the authors themselves, as the paper primarily synthesises existing research. Nevertheless, this limitation is mitigated by its comprehensive literature review, which offers a critical and detailed analysis of existing empirical studies, strongly positioning the paper as foundational for further applied research in this domain.

Regarding citation depth, the paper is highly cited within its field, referencing prominent studies such as those on private meeting summarisation and hierarchical recurrent neural networks. It integrates seminal works that have significantly influenced the field of automatic summarisation, thus validating its reliability and scholarly rigour.

In conclusion, this paper provides an excellent foundation, presenting deep analytical engagement with contemporary research methods, robustly aligning with MinuteMate’s objectives, and offering a valuable resource for methodological insights. Its detailed critique and synthesis of existing research effectively underpin MinuteMate's intended contributions to advancing AI-driven meeting summarisation solutions.
