Problem Statement (20%)

In professional services firms such as PwC, where client-facing roles demand both high productivity and detailed documentation, capturing accurate meeting minutes is a recurring challenge. Meetings often include complex discussions, action points, and decisions that need to be recorded and shared reliably across teams. However, the current process is heavily manual, relying on employees to take notes while actively participating, which leads to inconsistencies, information gaps, and a significant administrative burden.
From personal experience, I have frequently been tasked with minute-taking during client meetings. In these situations, I often struggled to keep up with the pace of conversation, particularly when clients spoke quickly or used unfamiliar terminology. These challenges are common for junior team members, who are often delegated the task but may not fully understand all aspects of the discussion. This can lead to incomplete, inaccurate, or delayed minutes, ultimately affecting project delivery and communication. Additionally, in face-to-face meetings, the act of taking notes, especially typing on a keyboard, can distract clients or make the environment feel overly formal, even resembling an interview or interrogation. This can reduce the openness of discussion, limiting the quality of information shared and impacting relationship-building.
While tools like Microsoft Copilot and Zoom transcription exist, they are often limited by generic outputs, lack of integration into day-to-day workflows, or restricted access within enterprise environments. Additionally, these tools are not always optimised for the specific needs of hybrid client engagements, where call quality, data sensitivity, and contextual summarisation are critical.
This project proposes MinuteMate, an AI-powered meeting assistant designed to address this gap by automating the recording, transcription, and summarisation of meetings. The tool will aim to reduce manual effort, improve consistency in communication, and enhance post-meeting productivity. This solution is particularly relevant for consultancy teams who frequently switch contexts between clients and require fast, reliable documentation to support delivery, compliance, and team coordination.
